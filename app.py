# FairAIED: Navigating Fairness, Bias, and Ethics in Educational AI Applications

Welcome to the **FairAIED** lab, an interactive environment designed to explore the critical concepts of fairness, bias, and ethics in the context of educational AI applications, particularly course recommendation systems.

Recommendation systems are pervasive, influencing decisions from entertainment to commerce. In education, they offer immense potential to guide students toward courses aligning with their interests, goals, and strengths. However, these systems, being data-driven, are susceptible to biases present in their training data. If unchecked, such biases can perpetuate or even amplify existing inequalities, leading to unfair or discriminatory recommendations for certain student groups.

This lab aims to provide a hands-on experience in understanding and addressing these challenges. Through interactive simulations and visualizations, you will:

*   **Understand Recommendation Systems**: Learn how these systems function and how they can inadvertently perpetuate existing biases.
*   **Explore Fairness Metrics**: Familiarize yourself with key fairness metrics such as Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, Equalized Odds, and Predictive Parity, and grasp their implications in educational contexts.
*   **Investigate Fairness Techniques**: Explore conceptual techniques to incorporate fairness constraints into recommendation algorithms.
*   **Analyze Trade-offs**: Understand the inherent trade-offs between fairness, accuracy, and diversity in recommendation systems.

Our journey will be informed by contemporary research in AI fairness, ensuring a robust and relevant learning experience. Use the navigation panel on the left to explore different aspects of fairness in educational AI.
