![Streamlit App Screenshot - Placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/1000x500?text=FairAIED+Streamlit+App+Screenshot)

## 📖 Project Description

Welcome to **FairAIED**, an interactive Streamlit lab project designed to explore the critical concepts of fairness, bias, and ethics within the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, with a particular focus on course recommendation systems.

Recommendation systems, while powerful tools for personalization in various domains, are susceptible to biases present in their training data. In an educational context, unchecked biases can lead to unfair or discriminatory course recommendations, perpetuating or amplifying existing inequalities among student groups.

This lab offers a hands-on experience to understand these challenges. Through configurable synthetic data generation, interactive visualizations, and comprehensive theoretical explanations, users will:

*   **Understand Recommendation Systems**: Grasp the fundamental mechanisms and how they can inadvertently perpetuate biases.
*   **Explore Fairness Metrics**: Familiarize themselves with key fairness metrics like Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, Equalized Odds, and Predictive Parity, and their implications.
*   **Investigate Fairness Techniques**: Learn about conceptual approaches to incorporate fairness constraints into AI algorithms.
*   **Analyze Trade-offs**: Understand the inherent compromises between fairness, accuracy, and diversity in AIED systems.
*   **Delve into Ethical Considerations**: Discuss broader ethical dilemmas and frameworks for responsible AI deployment in education.

The project is informed by contemporary research in AI fairness, providing a robust and relevant learning experience.

## ✨ Features

The FairAIED application is structured into several interactive sections accessible via the sidebar navigation:

### 1. Data Generation & Exploration
*   **Synthetic Data Generation**: Create artificial datasets simulating student profiles, course information, and student-course interactions.
*   **Configurable Parameters**: Adjust the `Number of Students`, `Number of Courses`, and `Bias Strength` to observe their impact on the generated data.
*   **Data Visualization**:
    *   Distributions of student GPAs and majors.
    *   Distributions of course difficulties and subject areas.
    *   **Bias Visualization**: An interactive heatmap showing average interaction scores by student major and course subject area, clearly demonstrating the effect of the introduced bias.

### 2. Fairness Notions & Metrics
*   **Core Definitions**: Comprehensive explanations of Individual Fairness and Group Fairness.
*   **Fairness Notations**: A detailed table of symbols and their definitions used in fairness literature.
*   **Mathematical Formulations**: In-depth descriptions and mathematical equations for key group fairness metrics:
    *   Statistical Parity (Demographic Parity)
    *   Equal Opportunity
    *   Equalized Odds
    *   Predictive Parity (Positive Predictive Value Parity)
    *   Predictive Equality (False Positive Rate Balance)
*   **Fairness Bonded Utility (FBU)**: Introduction to the FBU framework for evaluating the trade-offs between utility and fairness.

### 3. Ethical Approaches & Future Directions
*   **Bias Mitigation Techniques**: Overview of approaches to improve fairness categorized by the stage of intervention:
    *   **Pre-processing**: Re-weighing, Resampling (Oversampling, Undersampling).
    *   **In-processing**: Regularization Methods, Constraint-based Optimization, Adversarial Debiasing.
    *   **Post-processing**: Threshold Adjustment, Outcome Perturbation.
*   **Ethical Considerations**: Discussion of key ethical dilemmas in AIED: Bias and Discrimination, Privacy and Data Security, Autonomy and Agency, Transparency and Explainability, Accountability, and Digital Divide.
*   **Ethical Guidelines**: Exploration of common principles and frameworks for responsible AI in education.
*   **Tools & Datasets**: A curated list of open-source tools (e.g., AI Fairness 360, Fairlearn) and relevant datasets (e.g., TIMSS, PISA, OULAD) for fairness research in AIED.
*   **Challenges and Future Directions**: Insights into ongoing challenges in AI fairness (e.g., personalization vs. privacy, defining fairness) and promising future research avenues (e.g., Human-in-the-Loop AI, Intersectional Fairness).

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the FairAIED application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/FairAIED.git
    cd FairAIED
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    Create a `requirements.txt` file in the root directory of your project with the following content:

    ```
    streamlit>=1.0.0
    pandas>=1.0.0
    numpy>=1.20.0
    plotly>=5.0.0
    ```

    Then, install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 💻 Usage

To run the FairAIED application:

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is activated** (if you created one).
2.  **Navigate to the project's root directory** in your terminal.
3.  **Run the Streamlit application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    This command will open the application in your default web browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).

### Interacting with the Application

*   **Sidebar Controls**: Use the left-hand sidebar to navigate between different lab pages ("Data Generation & Exploration", "Fairness Notions & Metrics", "Ethical Approaches & Future Directions").
*   **Data Generation Parameters**: On the "Data Generation & Exploration" page, adjust the sliders in the sidebar for `Number of Students`, `Number of Courses`, and `Bias Strength` to see how they influence the synthetic data and visualizations.
*   **Explore Content**: Read through the explanations, examine the displayed dataframes, and interact with the plots to gain insights into fairness in AIED.
