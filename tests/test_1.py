    Test cases for `train_recommendation_model` covering expected functionality
    and edge cases such as invalid model types, incorrect data types, and empty datasets.

    Note: Given that the current implementation of `train_recommendation_model`
    is a `pass` stub, it will always return `None`. Therefore, the test cases
    expecting `TruncatedSVD` or `LogisticRegression` will fail because `isinstance(None, ExpectedType)`
    is false. These tests verify the *contract* of the function as described in its docstring
    and the notebook specification, assuming a future correct implementation.
    The test cases expecting exceptions (ValueError, TypeError) should pass
    if the function is correctly implemented to raise these for invalid inputs.
